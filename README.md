## Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea
1. REAL TIME BOARD ROOM EXPERIENCE : The Flow be like
2. Introduction of the candidate -> Ice Breaking questions -> In-depth techno-managerial questions
3. First the candidate must be interviewed about the knowledge he has on the subject.
4. Next the questions would be given according to the his/her knowledge.
5. QUESTIONS GENERATING : Categorize the questions based on the weightage ( Basic / Advanced ).
6. ANSWER CORRECTION : AI based correction based on key word reference and fluency in the answer.
7. SCORING MECHANISM :
8. SCORE FOR THE EXPERTS - Based on quality of questions asked.
9. SCORE FOR THE CANDIDATES - Based on the depth and fluency on the answer. This must include the knowledge of the candidate taken in the beginning of the process.
10. ASKING FEED BACK :
   We can ask feed back about the experts to the  candidate as well as about the improvement areas.
